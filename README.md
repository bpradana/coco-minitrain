# COCO `minitrain`

COCO `minitrain` is a mini training set (25K images â‰ˆ 20% of `train2017`) for COCO. It is useful for hyperparameter tuning and reducing the cost of ablation experiments. `minitrain`s object instance statistics match those of `train2017` (see the [stats page](STATS.md)).  \texttt{val2017} performance of a model trained on  \texttt{minitrain} is strongly positively correlated with the performance of the same model trained on the full set, \texttt{train2017} (see the Performance Correlation section below).

We introduced COCO `minitrain` in our HoughNet paper in ECCV'2020. Please cite our paper, if you use COCO `minitrain` in your work.

## More information

COCO `minitrain` is a subset of the COCO `train2017` dataset, and contains 25K images (about 20% of the `train2017` set) and  around 184K annotations across 80 object categories. We randomly sampled these images from the full set while preserving the following three quantities as much as possible:
* proportion of object instances from each class,
* overall ratios of small, medium and large objects,
* per class ratios of small, medium and large objects.

More information on `minitrain` statistics could be found in [STATS.md](STATS.md).

## Performance correlation of `train2017` and `minitrain`

Below figure compares object detection results on `train2017` and `minitrain`. This figure also shows the positive correlation between `train2017` and `minitrain` results. The Pearson correlation coefficients are **0.74** and **0.92** for COCO evaluation metrics *AP* and *AP50* respectively. This figure is based on the table above. *BaseModel* corresponds HoughNet model with ResNet-101 backbone.
